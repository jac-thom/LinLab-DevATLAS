# About
This github repo hosts a copy of the code and data files required for Aug 2023 submission of the DevATLAS manuscript to Nature Methods.<br>
Because this resource is intended to document the input, output, and code that generated results for a manuscript intended for peer review, nearly all of the exact data objects and results files generated in the analysis are available.
## submission_code
Contains the Jupyter Notebook files used to perform analysis and most output from that analysis.
## submission_data_GEO_Aug2023
Contains all of the data files required for submission to Nature Methods, including some data files used as input for submission code.
>[!WARNING]
>Due to the large size of even the compressed files, nearly all of the data files are actually stored at: `/home/upstate/submission_data_GEO_Aug2023`.
>This dir serves mostly as a pointer/reminder of the location of the raw data files. It also contains `file_list.txt` outlining all files present on the VM.
